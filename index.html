            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>This website features my work as a research economist and as a ceramicist. </p> 
            <p>I am an associate professor of economics at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, Ohio, where I've been a member of the Department of Economics since 2007. </p>
            <p>My academic research uses applied econometrics and experimental methods and touches on questions in social and cultural economics, economic history, labor economics, and entrepreneurship. </p>
            <p>My active research projects explore 1) the labor market effects of automation and 2) what the working lives of craft entrepreneurs tell us about meaningful work in a relentlessly automating world. </p>
            <p>I have been making things with clay, primarily functional ware using handbuiding techniques, for two years. I'm a member of Brick Ceramic and Design studio, also in Cleveland. </p>
